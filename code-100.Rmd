## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r disease}
# import data and inspect
#
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data(us_contagious_diseases)
str(us_contagious_diseases)
 

# assign dat to the per 10,000 rate of measles, removing Alaska and Hawaii and adjusting for weeks reporting
#
the_disease <- "Measles"
dat <- us_contagious_diseases %>%
  filter(!state %in% c("Hawaii", "Alaska") & disease == the_disease) %>%
  mutate(rate = count / population * 10000 * 52/weeks_reporting) %>%
  mutate(state = reorder(state, rate))



```


```{r ggplot tile}
# tile plot of disease rate by state and year
#
dat %>% ggplot(aes(year, state, fill=rate)) +
        geom_tile(color = "grey50") +
        scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
        scale_fill_gradientn(colors = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(9, "PuRd"), trans = "sqrt") +
        geom_vline(xintercept = 1963, col = "cyan") +
        theme_minimal() + theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
        ggtitle(the_disease) +
        ylab("") +
        xlab("")
```

\newpage

```{r ggplot line}

# plot disease rates per year in California
#
dat %>% filter(state == "California" & !is.na(rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, rate)) +
  geom_line() +
  ylab("Cases per 10,000") +
  geom_vline(xintercept=1963, col = "blue")


```
\newpage

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
